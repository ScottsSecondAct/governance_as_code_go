## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report vulnerabilities privately using one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting:** Use the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/ScottsSecondAct/governance_as_code_go/security/advisories/new) page to submit a private report directly on GitHub.
2. **Email:** Send details to **scott@ScottsSecondAct.com**.

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected version(s)
- Potential impact

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment** within 72 hours of your report
- **Status update** within 7 days with an initial assessment
- **Resolution timeline** communicated once the issue is confirmed
- Credit in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Scope

As a Go policy enforcement and compliance library, relevant security concerns include:

- Logic flaws that cause deny-wins or fail-closed semantics to be bypassed
- Incorrect policy evaluation leading to unauthorized access grants
- Unsafe handling of untrusted input passed to policy or compliance rule functions
- Goroutine safety issues if the engine is used concurrently

### Out of Scope

- Issues requiring physical access to the machine
- Social engineering
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies with existing upstream fixes (please check first)
